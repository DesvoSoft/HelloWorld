# Hello world

A website project to practice git, learn about technologies, and share general content.
I will try to follow good practices and add content once in a while, any advise will be much appreciated.

It has information about Python fundamentals, so it can be useful for an introduction to the language.

  The navigation bar was highly improved, with a minimalist responsive design.

  Big update: an entire new page was added with basic information about the fundamentals with Pythons, this HTML works with a separate CSS file (./src/style2.css) to make small differents but withtout affecting the original style of the index homepage. The content added is in Spanish, but looking forward to add it in English as well.

  A new page was added to add JS content.
  The file organization was drastically updated.
  CSS is now modular, and it has files for specific page needs.
  Not a very visual change, but this will help maintaining, debuggin, extend and adapt the project.

  A new page with Git content was added, it has basic guidance about it, and more complex scenarios. Also the JS page was updated with a currency converter for ARG, I want to use an API for this, but I am still learning how to obfuscate the code to prevent public API keys. Navbar menu was fixed.
