A project to practice git and learn about new frameworks.
I will try to follow guidelines and good practices in this project, any advise will be really appreciate it.

Update Oct. 12 2023:
I have added some content from previous SD outcomes, and I have played around with JS to create a slider (probably will update or change it later) to display the content.
